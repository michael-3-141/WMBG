    <string name="helpText">Search books: This option allows you to view, edit and delete the books you added. You can also send reminders to the person who lent the book. \n\nScan Book: This button will allow you to scan a books barcode, and do different actions to the book you scanned. You can add it to your list, lend it to someone if you already added it or mark it as returned it if you added it and it is already lended to someone.\n\nManually add book: This option allows to add a new book without scanning a barcode. This is especially useful when your book does not have a barcode or it doesn\'t have an isbn barcode. You can still enter an isbn manually if you want.\n\nWhat is an isbn? An isbn is an International Serial Book Number. It is a unique number that identifies a certain book. It can be 10 or 13 digits and can be found either under the barcode or in the copyright info page. The barcode of the book isn\'t always the ISBN number! If you scan a book and get a message saying the ISBN is invalid, try tapping "Manually add book" and entering the ISBN code (written under the barcode or in the copyright info page) into the ISBN number field at the top of the screen, and press OK. Wait a moment and the book info should be automatically filled for you.</string>
